** App Changes **

* Changed the attack word pairs in /backend/data

* Changed parameters in /backend/config.py
	
* added an additional attention check towards the end of the comparisons -> /backend/utils.py

* changed the progress bar to be out of 25 
	-> /frontend/src/components/Experiment/*Verification.jsx

* commented out the Mobile device check in /frontend/src/App.jsx. Track this within qualtrics.

* added in the audio files (then removed them again before ziping as the file is too big for git)
        * would a .gitignore file help here?

* Make the attack script return all 5 attacks in a list from one function call.  More efficient and avoids repeated attacks.

* Set the position of the attention checks first, to prevent an attention check overwriting an attack instance.

* fixed bug that made same 5 attacks be presented each time.  Needed a random int based on len(attack_pairs['pairs'])

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* added a SimType url parameter to enable selection of the type of attacks to be shown to the user. 
  Ensured that this value was set to a safe default ('phon') in the case of not having the required parameters.
  
* Updated the database to include the similarity type variable.
* Renamed the isMturk variable to RecruitSource so as to better reflect ot's new intended usage.

* Required URL parameters (passed from Qualtrics)
        - SimType
        - ParticipantID
        - RecruitSource
