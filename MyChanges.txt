** App Changes **

* Changed the attack word pairs in /backend/data

* Changed parameters in /backen/config.py
	BASE_FILE_LOCATION = "" #B700
	NUMBER_OF_ATTACKS = 5
	NUMBER_OF_ROUNDS = 25
	NUMBER_OF_WORDS = 5

	# Number of initial rounds that can't contain an attack
	GRACE_ROUNDS = 4 

	# Not zero indexed
	#ATTENSION_CHECK_ROUND = 3 
	
* added an additional attention check towards the end of the comparisons -> /backend/utils.py


* changed the progress bar to be out of 25 
	-> /frontend/src/components/Experiment/*Verification.jsx

* commented out the Mobile device check in /frontend/src/App.jsx

* added in the audio files (then removed them again before ziping as the file is too big for git)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Issues -

* When the app loads on the development server, the words of the fingerpint do not appear.

* I'm guessing that it's something to do with the frontend code?
* I have updated npm and I guess this migh tbe part of the issue?

(I'm not actally too sure about what's happening on the frontend as I haven't got my head around Javascript yet)
